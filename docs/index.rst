Welcome to Coclust's documentation!
==========================================

**Coclust** provides both a Python package, and a ready to use script to perform co-clustering.

The script enables the user to process a dataset with co-clustering algorithms without writing Python code.

The Python package provides an API for Python programmers.  This API allows to use the algorithms in a pipeline with scikit-learn library for example.


**Coclust** includes implementations of several diagonal and non-diagonal co-clustering algorithms.
